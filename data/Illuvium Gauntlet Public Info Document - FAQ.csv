",,,,,,,"Answer: The Hyper system is an affinity-based mechanic where illuvials build up their ""Hyper Meter"" as they battle units that they affinity-counter (Water vs Fire, for example).

As the Hyper Meter fills, the units becomes more powerful. On full Hyper Meter, the unit receives a significant power boost.
Check the ""Hyper"" sheet for more info on this!"

,"Question: What is the ""T0/Lynx Spawns Panel"" showing?",,,,,,,Question: Why does the Tier 2 have such low odds compared to other tiers?
,,,,,,,,
,"Answer: It shows the available T0 units for that match, as well as what the Lynx becomes on S3.

In total, there are 25 different T0 units, but only 12 of them are available each match, at random. The panel shows you which units you will be able to see in the shop in the on-going match.

Lynx can also become only one variation, chosen at random on match start and shown in the panel for visibility.",,,,,,,"Answer: That is because Tier 2 has only one unit - the Lynx, compared to the other tiers that have 5+ units.

Giving Tier 2 higher odds would mean that it would be way too easy to get it to Stage 3.
Even in its current state, it is moderately easy to get the Lynx to Stage 3.

Furthermore, to counter the low odds, the Lynx can be found through a wide range of levels, having at least 5% chance from level 2 up to 7. Even on level 8, it still has a solid 3% chance (it might seem low, but in the Lynx case it really isn't)."

,Question: Why are there different T0 units and Lynxes every match?,,,,,,,"Question: How can I see ""Damage Dealt"" information?"
,,,,,,,,
,"Answer: There are multiple reasons for this.

Firstly, both T0s and Lynxes are unique in the fact that there are a lot of variations of them - too many to fit them into the Gauntlet Format.

Secondly, having different variations of them adds diversity from match to match, as this opens up new comp possibilities.

Finally, it's a tool for people to express their skill by adapting each game depending on what T0 and Lynx units are available.",,,,,,,"Answer: On top of the ""Synergies"" Panel, you can see 3 buttons.

The one in the middle sends you to ""Combat Stats"" - there you can see Damage Dealt, but you can also further browse through with the buttons below to reach the ""Damage Received"" and ""Shield & Healing"" panels.

The one on the right sends you to ""Hyper"" panel, that shows you an overview of the units' Hyper Bars.

The one on the left sends you back to ""Synergies"" panel."

,"Question: What is different on ""Leviathan"" mode?",,,,,,,Question: Why does Lynx have no affinity/class on S1 and no affinity on S2?
,,,,,,,,
,"Answer: On Leviathan mode you get to play with the units that you own!

That means that if you own, let's say, a level 45 Phosphorus, you'll get it to replace the usual Level 1 Phosphorus with the Level 45 one.

The replacement happens automatically, the owned units appear in the shop instead of the default Level 1 ones.

In short: On Leviathan mode players get to showcase their owned Illuvials.",,,,,,,"Answer: Because he's special like that!

 - Lynx is the only unit of Tier 2.
 - Lynx can become any class or affinity (random each match)
 - Lynx starts with no affinity or class
 - Lynx unlocks its class on Stage 2
 - Lynx uncloks its affinity on Stage 3"
